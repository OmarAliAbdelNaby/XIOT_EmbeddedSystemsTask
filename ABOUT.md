# Accomplishment:
- To Turn the LED on when the switch is pressed, using interrupt.
- And to send indications to the serial monitor, using UART.

# Process:
I developed this applications with 2 secnarios I have imagined.
So you will find another commentd ISR to behave as Secnario 2:-
- Secnario 1:
  when the Switch is pressed, the LED is turned on and still as it is ON forever. And send the indications throw the monitor.
- Secnario 2:
  when the switch is pressed, the LED will toggle with every press. I thought that will make it more realistic.
  
# Lessons learned:
I have gained more experience, I was familiar with the interrupts and UART.

# Experience:
- Working now on a project: OBD to record failures with times (using RTC) on EEPROM of ATMega32 connected with other microcontroller (using I2C) that takes some actions, as a feature in AutoPilot system.
- Locker door with password, using ATMega32.
- Full diploma in Embedded systems, from Embedded Fab, worked on ATMega32.
