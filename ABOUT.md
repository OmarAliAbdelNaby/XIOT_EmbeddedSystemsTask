# Accomplishment:
- To Turn the LED on when the switch is pressed, using interrupt.
- And to send indications to the serial monitor, using UART.

# Process:
I developed this applications with 2 secnarios I have imagined, so you will find another commentd ISR to behave as Secnario 2:-
- Secnario 1:
  when the Switch is pressed, the LED is turned on and still as it is ON forever. And send the indications throw the monitor.
- Secnario 2:
  when the switch is pressed, the LED will toggle with every press. I thought that will make it more realistic.
